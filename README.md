# pwn.college helper environment for kernel development and exploitation

**Source-only version** of https://breaking-bits.gitbook.io/breaking-bits/exploit-development/linux-kernel-exploit-development 's GitHub repo https://github.com/ChrisTheCoolHut/Linux_kernel_exploitation .

Pre-requistite:

Building the kernel, busybox, and demo modules:

```
$ ./build.sh
```

Running the kernel (each version):

```
$ ./00-launch*.sh
```

All modules will be in `/kern_modules/`, ready to be `insmod`ed, and the host's home directory will be mounted as `/home/ctf` in the guest.

The 5 blog posts need launch of the 5 seperate launch scripts. `00-*.sh` ... `04-*.sh`.

## Testing out your solution

Make it static so linker/libc doesn't matter

`gcc solve/mything.c -o fs/mything -static`
